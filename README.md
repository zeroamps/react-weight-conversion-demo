# React Weight Conversion Demo

This is a React Weight Conversion Demo application, which you can see on [DEMO](https://zeroamps.github.io/react-weight-conversion-demo/).

I created this demo because I wanted to try [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/), which is a React form library.
